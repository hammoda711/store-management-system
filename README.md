    - `Customer`: Places orders and interacts with the system.
    - `Product`: Represents the items available for sale.
4. **Sales Reports**:
  
  - Generate sales reports to analyze performance.
  - View total sales over specific periods.

  - Receive warnings when stock levels are low.
  - Ensure timely restocking to prevent shortages.
